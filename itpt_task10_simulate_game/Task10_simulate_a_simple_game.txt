Implement and test a program to simulate a simple game. Your program should do the following:

	1. Store six colours in an external file (Note: these colours can be your choice of words or graphics).
	2. Create three arrays and input the colours to each of the arrays.
	3. For each of the three arrays, create a random number between 1 and 6 and output that colour to the screen.
	4. If two of the colours match, the user wins 50 pence.
	5. If all three colours match, the user wins £1.
	6. Allow the user to have five ‘shots’ and keep track of their winnings.
	7. Display suitable messages on screen.
