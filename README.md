# ITPT_Project_Python1

This Project contains 10 programing tasks (my Project for IT Professional Training (ITPT) School). 

## Task 1
Scottish Athletics is running trials for 400 metre athletes. There are four groups of eight athletes. The runners run two separate laps and their times are recorded as they complete each of the two laps. Any runner who completes either of the two laps in under 50 seconds progresses to the next stage of selection. The runner from each of the groups with the fastest lap will receive a medal of commendation.

The task is:
  to write a program for one of the groups of female runners
  find the runners who will progress to the next stage
  find the runner with the fastest lap
  Save this information to a file. You can assume that no two runners have the same name.

The program requires the following inputs:
  a valid number of runners
  the first and second name of each runner
  the time taken to run the first lap
  the time taken to run the second lap
  The output from the program should display the fastest runner, each runnerâ€™s name
  and indicate whether they will progress to the next stage of selection.
